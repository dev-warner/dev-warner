## <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7RgN9ijwE4" class="wave no-link">👋</a> Hi! I'm Joe Warner.

I try to write code and explain what's going on. I'm constantly trying to get better at what I do and help the community grow.

I'm a Front End Engineer [@amplience]() working on [Dynamic Content](). I live in rainy Manchester <span class="bee">🐝</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="bee__hidden">🌹</span>, and I shit post on [Twitter]() 🐦 about the latest and greatest in the front end space.

I hope you'll come along for the ride & sign up for my newsletter 💌 below. I send out articles i've found helpful and you'll get the latest (and not so greatest) posts from me.

You can find my [Github]() and my [StackOverflow]() here, if you wanna check out what i'm coding and struggling to code right now.
